# JAVA Academy: Scrum

## Introduction

We learn about Scrum,a framework by which people can address complex adaptive problems, while delivering products of the highest possible value productively and creatively.

## Notes

**Manifesto for Agile Software Development**

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- **Individuals and interactions** *over processes and tools*
- **Working software** *over comprehensive documentation*
- **Customer collaboration** *over contract negotiation*
- **Responding to change** *over following a plan*

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more

**Principles behind the Agile Manifesto**

*We follow these principles:*

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in
development. Agile processes harness change for
the customer's competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a
couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a
preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work
together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals.
Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of
conveying information to and within a development
team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development.
The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done--is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

**Scrum**

Scrum is based on the theory of control of empirical processes or empiricism. The empiricism ensures that knowledge comes from experience and taking decisions based on what is known. The Scrum components are: 

*Team*
- Product Owner: Responsible for maximizing value of the product.
- Scrum Master: Responsible for promoting and support Scrum.
- Development team: Professionals who carry out the job to deliver an increment product "Finished"

*Events*

- Sprint: It is the heart of Scrum where it is created an increase in product.
- Sprint planning: Ceremony to define what will be done during the sprint.
- Daily Scrum (Daily stand-up): Daily meeting of the entire team growth.
- Sprint review: This is where the increment is shown developed during the sprint
- Sprint retrospective: Opportunity to apply continuous improvement

*Artifacts*

- Product Backlog: It's an ordered list of everything I know what is necessary in the product.
- Sprint Backlog: Items in the Product List selected for the Sprint.
